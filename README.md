The ESP32 is the ESP8266 successor loaded with lots of new features. The ESP32 is a development board that combines Wi-Fi and Bluetooth wireless capabilities, and it’s dual core. It supports a wide variety of peripherals such as: capacitive touch, ADC, DAC, I2C, SPI, UART, I2S, PWM and much more. It is one of the best solutions for DIY Internet of Things Projects and Smart Home Projects.
